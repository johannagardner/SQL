-- In this project, I ran queries on sales and employee data for a music company.

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US

select FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
from chinook.customers
where Country <> 'USA'

-- Show only the Customers from Brazil.

select FirstName, LastName 
from chinook.customers
where Country like '%Brazil%'

-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

select FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
from chinook.invoices i
left join chinook.customers c
on i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
where BillingCountry = 'Brazil'

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents

select FirstName, LastName
from chinook.employees 
where Title = 'Sales Support Agent'

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table
select distinct BillingCountry 
from chinook.invoices
order by BillingCountry asc

----Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

select e.FirstName, e.LastName, i.InvoiceId
from chinook.invoices i
left join chinook.customers c

--Show the employees and who they report to
select e.FirstName as empfirst, e.LastName as emplast, s.FirstName as supfirst, s.LastName as suplast
from chinook.employees e
full outer join chinook.employees s
on s.EmployeeId=e.ReportsTo
where empfirst is not null


--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers (I chose to sort them by customer last name)
select inv.total as invoice_total, cust.firstname as c_first, cust.lastname as c_last, cust.country as c_country, emp.firstname as e_first, emp.lastname as e_last
from invoices inv
left join customers cust
on inv.customerid= cust.customerid
left join employees emp

order by c_last

--How many Invoices were there in 2009?
select count(*)

--What are the total sales for 2009?
select SUM(total)

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
select tracks.name, ii.invoicelineid

--Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre, and sort by album name
select t.name as track_name, a.title as album_title, mt.name as media_type_name, g.name as genre_name

----Show the total sales made by each sales agent
